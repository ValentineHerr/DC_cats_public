# B_Random_Thinning_Analysis

This folder contains the data and script to reproduce the cat random thining spatial capture reactpure analis of the paper.

Because that analysis is so computer intensive:
  - the study area was divided in 4 blocks. The data for each block is given in files data_block[1-4].Rdata. In those files, the location of the traps have been altered because it is sensitive information.
  - the results of each blocks and the trace plots of the MCMC chains are given in folder "preared_restuls".


the files in RandomThinning_Scripts are adapted from Ben Augustine's code found here.
